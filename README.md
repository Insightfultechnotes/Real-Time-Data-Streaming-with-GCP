# Real-Time Temperature Streaming Project (Google Cloud Platform)

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **real-time data pipeline** using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** services. A simulated temperature sensor sends data to **Pub/Sub**, which triggers a **Cloud Function** to store the data in **Cloud Storage**. The data can then be analyzed using **BigQuery** and visualized with **Looker Studio**.
